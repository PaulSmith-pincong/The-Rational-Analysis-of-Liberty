# The-Rational-Analysis-of-Liberty
I believe there's no such thing as absolute or reasonable denial of objective morality and liberty, so I've started this project to substantiate the essence of eternal form of liberty

Preface
Whenever people including philosophers mentioned the words tightly related to morality or religious especially christian background, LIBERTY, EQUALITY, FRATERNITY, KINDNESS, GUILT, SIN, GLORY, for example, they would just take them as invalid supernatural things and attached the quality and description of subjective or arbitrary concepts of nought to them.
But don't they even consider the possibility that they've made a mistake, like they judging the words just by what they've thought of in a limited realm and exactly what they would like to see, instead of fixing up the principles of rational analysis, internalizing everything with inclination to come into the existence of those linguistic expressisons into every singular concepts?
It's more than natural for anyone to make a mistake, but never should a mistake be put onto an altar and forgiven by reality or Lord or something. Out of awareness of my humanity belief and responsibility for sobering and enlightenment of everyone, I decided to present some forms of concise and rational analysis of a set of concepts in this book hoping that may help us nurture a better knowledge and understanding on WHAT we are defending when we try to bring liberty and protect human rights around the globe.
It will take time and energy to accomplish this work, and I know it worthwhile basically.
